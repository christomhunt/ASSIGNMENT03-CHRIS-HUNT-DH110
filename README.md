## Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements

### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

This project would support users who want to learn music theory.

### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?

This activity fulfills the users basic needs for self esteem and self actualization. Self esteem because the users are learning something new. Self actualization because they are able to tap into their creative side.

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

The traditional solution has been to take music theory lessons at a studio with an instructor doing 1 on 1 lessons.

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?

Music lessons are expensive. An average music lesson is somewhere in the $30-45 range for a 30 minute session and for someone who is new to it they may not be willing to shell out the money especially if they don't know if they will actually stick with this.

## Step 2: Target users

### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)

Demographic: anyone who wants to learn music from kids to adults

Preference: anyone who can retain information (e.g. someone with dementia would have a hard time learning music theory)

Expertise: no expertise required

### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?

Users can learn music theory anywhere they can wear headphones or listen to the lessons and hear what is going on.

### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 

The goal of the user would be to find the lesson they want to do and start it.

## Step 3: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 

I decided to do a participant interview and observation over Zoom where both the researcher and participant can take part in the call from the comfort of their residence or wherever they choose to join the call from.

## Step 4: Plan the details

The first task I had the participant do was find a music learning service in the area or online and we talked about how they felt about it.

The second task the participant looked at the website I am looking at musictheory.net and we talked about how they felt about it.

I collected data via a video recording on Zoom where the participant shared their camera, and their screen with me. I also transcribed the audio from the Zoom call into text so it is easier to follow along and look back at what was talked about.

Insights from the interview
A review from a credible source would be helpful for possible customers/users to gauge if they should even spend their time and effort to learn whatever they want to learn the way the website they are looking at wants to teach them.
“But if they had some kind of social validation with some bigger music personality that actually gave their stamp of approval that would make me maybe stay on this website a little bit longer not saying I would be convinced, or that I'm easily impressionable.” Nikki (20:25)
Having a system that uses existing accounts instead of having to sign up and create a completely new user ID for example logging in via Facebook, Google, Apple ID would enable for a quicker and easier process for possible customers/users.
“Why would I prefer on Zoom, because in today's day and age, we already have so many things that we're signed up to man. So many things that it's much easier if I could just sign up. Or or I could just use something I already have zoom or login with with Google, I guess to wyzent with their API, I don't know something like that.” Nikki (22:42)
Explaining terminology/words that people may not know what they are for example Tenuto is musictheory.net exercises and tools in an App.
“I don't know what tenuto does the app I don't know if it it shows me chords from the looks of it. Uhh or if it records or if it's a notation software, it doesn't tell me much, which is kind of a turn off. It's a turn off that I don't know” Nikki (33:01)
Offering support for different browsers like Brave which has 50 million monthly users and 15 million daily users as of Dec 2021 according to their website.
“the fact that they don't support brave, for example, and here is the confirmation. Our list of supported web browsers for the 2021 2022 school year, includes what I was saying. Uhh uhh and it doesn't include brave, of course, it's not one of the biggest ones.” Nikki (35:55)
Making the learning more fun in almost like a game-like way where you get gratification after completing a lesson etc.
“It can make it a little bit more fun. I guess. instead of it just being like black and white text.” Nikki (37:48)
“It it's just knowing how to trigger certain neural receptors in your brain so that you get that gratification.” Nikki (43:45)
## Reflection
The contextual inquiry process really opened up new things I had never considered to try regarding what to research etc. By talking to the user how and why  they use the product and watching them another product with the same goal in mind music learning but also the product I’m looking into brought a fresh new perspective that I could now dissect what they talked about. By writing a transcript for the entire interview/observation I was able to go back and hear things over and catch stuff I may not have caught when I was actively working with the user. However this format was more free and the user did go off on tangents sometimes that took away time and I didn’t get to cover some of the things I wanted to. In the future I will need to figure out how to redirect the user if they get strayed off on a tangent or maybe I did okay and the stuff I didn’t get to ask about was made up by keeping the user in their flow while also getting some of the stuff done that I wanted to. The participants' ability to talk with passion about the subject came across very strongly and their expertise was really valuable. I was confident I had a solid user who I was working with because they had been involved in the field and we're going through some of my questions without being asked. I didn’t get to check as thoroughly as I wanted while the call was going on what questions were being covered and not but I would glance at them when the user was talking to make sure I was generally headed in the right direction. After completing the contextual inquiry process I can see why it is a super valuable park of the UX process and why I will be incorporating it into my future works.
